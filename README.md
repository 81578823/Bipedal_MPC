# Model Predictive Control for Bipedal Robot PF_A in MuJoCo Simulator
![video](./display.gif)

This work is focused on the study of convex MPC for bipedal robots.
Convex model predictive control can be applied not only to quadruped robots but also to biped robots.

# Important matter
**This project is currently running only on ros2！！**

**Please check the ros versions supported by your operating system！！**

# Build Package
## Install ROS2 according to your operating system (my operating system is ubuntu 22.04 with ros2-humble)
If you are freshman, it is recommended to use this command line in terminal:
```bash
wget http://fishros.com/install -O fishros && . fishros
```
First, choose 1: '一键安装(推荐):ROS(支持ROS/ROS2,树莓派Jetson)'.

Second, choose 1: '更换系统源再继续安装'.

Third, choose 1: 'humble(ros2)'.

Finally, choose 1: 'humble(ros2)桌面版'.

Then, the ros2 is successfully installed. For more details please refer to [fishros](https://github.com/fishros/install). Thank fishros for his contributions!!!!!!!

If ros2 cannot be successfully installed in your operating system, please refer to [ROS2](https://ros.org/) official doc.

## Dependency
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros2-distro>-eigenpy
sudo apt-get install ros-<ros2-distro>-pinocchio
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```

For ros2(humble)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-eigenpy
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-pinocchio
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
```

For third party
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giaf/hpipm.git
cd hpipm
git checkout v0.1.0  # 使用兼容版本

# 2. 编译安装
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/81578823/Bipedal_MPC.git
```

```bash
cd Bipedal_MPC & bash build.sh
echo "source ~/Bipedal_MPC/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Run Package
## Run Simulation
```bash
ros2 launch sim sim_launch.py 
```

## Run Controller
```bash
ros2 launch management management_launch.py 
```

# Change Velocity
if don't have the remote controller, you can change the linear velocity and angular velocity on this code file:
![photo](./velocity_get.jpg)

Then you can change the velocities on the JoyStick::getLinearVelCmd() and JoyStick::getYawVelCmd() (default: 0.4 (linear); 0.0 (angular))

# Future work
Nowadays, more and more people are used to using python. 
Hence, we will focus on converting the C++ work into a respository in python. So please waiting ...
